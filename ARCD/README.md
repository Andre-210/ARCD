Changes in Explore Page:

Added a possible rooms and themes section, to give the user an idea as to what rooms and themes may appear in the generated images. A caption to the images was also added to let the user know the room and theme of the currently displayed image. Text bubbles were added to improve the appearance of the page. The about section was removed, the previous iteration was too long and in general made the page have too much text.
